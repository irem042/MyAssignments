Exercise 2 - Efficient Heap Construction

Description:
In this exercise, the goal is to build a heap more efficiently, in O(n) time, instead of inserting elements one by one (which takes O(n log n) time).  
The task involves writing code that constructs a heap directly from an unsorted array using the bottom-up heapify approach.

Output:
The heap is not empty; it contains 6 entries.
The largest entry is 21


Removing entries in descending order:
Removing 21
Removing 20
Removing 15
Removing 14
Removing 10
Removing 2

Notes:
- The main focus is to understand how the heap can be built efficiently using the heapify process.  
- The provided hint in the assignment was used to implement the optimized construction.
